# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Users need a fluid way to manage their daily schedules without clicking through complex forms. Traditional calendars are often rigid. Smart Agenda AI bridges the gap by allowing natural language interaction ("Remind me to call John at 5 PM") alongside visual agenda management.

## User Goals
- Quickly add tasks/events via voice or text.
- Have a clear view of "Today's" agenda without clutter.
- Receive timely reminders on desktop and mobile (via Telegram).
- Manage recurring routines easily.

## Key Workflows
1.  **Capture**: User types a request in Chat ("Meeting tomorrow at 10am").
2.  **Process**: AI parses intent -> App updates DB.
3.  **Notify**: App schedules browser notification + sends Telegram message.
4.  **Review**: User checks "My Day" or "Calendar" tab to see the schedule.
